# Java Socket Programming (Client–Server Model)

This project demonstrates a simple Client-Server communication model using Java sockets.
The server listens on port **9000**, accepts a connection from a client, and exchanges
messages until the client sends the command 'bye'.

## Features
- ServerSocket for accepting client connections
- Socket for two-way communication
- BufferedReader for reading character data
- PrintWriter for sending responses
- Clean and minimal code for easy understanding
- Perfect for university assignments and OS/Networking labs

## How to Run

### Step 1: Run the Server

### Step 2: Run the Client

### Step 3: Use Client Commands
- Type any message → server will reply
- Type **bye** → disconnect

## Technologies Used
- Java (Core)
- ServerSocket
- Socket
- InputStreamReader
- BufferedReader
- PrintWriter
